To write functional, easily scalable code in VBA, you’ll need to adopt new ideas and let go of others.

```vb
Public Sub RunChain()

    Dim res As clsResult
    Set res = ResultOk(5) _
        .Bind("MyFunc1") _
        .Bind("MyFunc2")
    
    If res.IsSuccess Then
        Debug.Print "? " & res.value
    Else
        Debug.Print "? " & res.Error
    End If
    
End Sub
```

And the chain can be easily extended:
```vb
    Set res = ResultOk(5) _
        .Bind("MyFunc3") _
        .Bind("MyFunc1") _
        .Bind("MyFunc4") _        
        .Bind("MyFunc2")
```

**New habits:**
1. Any function that can fail must return a special type (`clsResult`).
2. An error is not an accident—it’s a normal state for such functions.
3. Functions that may “fail” contain explicit error-handling logic.
4. Initially, your project code will be longer, but as functionality grows, it will expand *less* than non-functional code—and will become clearer, simpler, and easier to modify.
5. A well-structured chain won’t crash; instead, it will propagate any error to the end.
6. Logging and similar concerns no longer need to be scattered across many places—they’re centralized in the result type’s class.
7. Functions that may “fail” should not construct the result type directly. Instead, use dedicated factory functions:

```vb
'=== Factories ===
' Success factory
Public Function ResultOk(ByVal value As Variant) As clsResult
    Dim r As New clsResult
    r.InitOk value
    Set ResultOk = r
End Function

' Error factory
Public Function ResultErr(ByVal errorMsg As String) As clsResult
    Dim r As New clsResult
    r.InitErr errorMsg
    Set ResultErr = r
End Function
```

Example of a function that may fail (now robust and reliable):
```vb
' Function 2: converts a number to a string with the prefix "Result: "
Public Function MyFunc2(value As Variant) As clsResult
    If Not IsNumeric(value) Then
        Set MyFunc2 = ResultErr("MyFunc2: expected a number")
        Exit Function
    End If
    
    Set MyFunc2 = ResultOk("Result: " & CStr(CDbl(value)))
End Function
```

### **How VBA “thinks” and executes this chain:**

```vba
Set res = ResultOk(5) _
    .Bind("MyFunc1") _
    .Bind("MyFunc2")
```

VBA is an **imperative language** and **knows nothing about functional programming**. It simply executes method calls **left to right**, treating the chain as a sequence of object method invocations. However, thanks to how we designed `clsResult`, this **appears as functional composition**.

---

### 🔁 Step-by-step execution:

#### 🔹 Step 1: `ResultOk(5)`
- VBA calls the **global function** `ResultOk(5)` (e.g., from module `modResult`).
- This function creates a **new instance of `clsResult`**.
- Internally:  
  ```vb
  m_value = 5  
  m_error = ""  
  m_isSuccess = True
  ```
- Returns this object.

> ✅ Now we have a **successful `clsResult` containing the value `5`**.

---

#### 🔹 Step 2: `.Bind("MyFunc1")`
- VBA takes the object from Step 1 and calls `.Bind("MyFunc1")` on it.
- Inside the `Bind` method:
  1. Checks: `m_isSuccess = True` → **proceed**.
  2. Executes:  
     ```vba
     Set nextResult = Application.Run("MyFunc1", m_value)
     ```
     → Equivalent to calling:  
     ```vba
     MyFunc1(5)
     ```
  3. Suppose `MyFunc1` returns a **new `clsResult`** with value `50` (success).
  4. This new object is returned as the result of `.Bind(...)`.

> ✅ Now we have a **new `clsResult` with value `50`**.

---

#### 🔹 Step 3: `.Bind("MyFunc2")`
- VBA takes the object from Step 2 (value `50`) and calls `.Bind("MyFunc2")`.
- Inside `Bind`:
  1. `m_isSuccess = True` → continue.
  2. Calls: `MyFunc2(50)`
  3. Suppose `MyFunc2` returns a `clsResult` with the string `"Result: 50"`.
  4. This object is returned.

> ✅ Now we have a **`clsResult` containing `"Result: 50"`**.

---

#### 🔹 Step 4: `Set res = ...`
- VBA assigns the **final object** to the variable `res`.

---

### 🧠 How VBA “sees” the chain

For VBA, this is just a **sequence of method calls**:

```vba
Dim temp1 As clsResult
Dim temp2 As clsResult
Dim temp3 As clsResult

Set temp1 = ResultOk(5)
Set temp2 = temp1.Bind("MyFunc1")
Set temp3 = temp2.Bind("MyFunc2")
Set res = temp3
```

The line-continuation underscore (`_`) is merely **syntactic sugar**. VBA **does nothing “smart”**—it just invokes methods one after another, each time receiving a **new object** (or the same one, if it’s an error).

---

### ❗ What if an error occurs?

Suppose `MyFunc1` returns an error:

- At Step 2: `MyFunc1(5)` returns a `clsResult` with `m_isSuccess = False` and `m_error = "something went wrong"`.
- At Step 3: `.Bind("MyFunc2")` is called **on this error object**.
- Inside `Bind`:  
  ```vba
  If Not m_isSuccess Then
      Set Bind = Me   ' ← returns itself, without calling MyFunc2!
      Exit Function
  End If
  ```
- Thus, `MyFunc2` is **never invoked**.
- The error **flows through** to the end of the chain.

> ✅ This is **monadic behavior**: errors automatically short-circuit computation—but **don’t crash the program**.

---

### 💡 Why is this powerful?

- You **don’t write `If Not IsError Then ...`** at every step.
- The code is **linear**, even though the logic is branching.
- Errors are **explicit**, not hidden inside `On Error Resume Next`.
- It’s easy to **add new steps**.

---

### 📌 Important: VBA doesn’t optimize chains

Each `.Bind` creates a **new `clsResult` object** (or returns the existing one).  
This is **not lazy evaluation**—everything executes **immediately and sequentially**.

But in the context of VBA and Excel, this is **perfectly acceptable**—performance is rarely critical here.

---

### ✅ Summary

VBA “thinks” like this:  
> “First, get the object from `ResultOk(5)`.  
> Then call `.Bind("MyFunc1")` on it → get a new object.  
> Then call `.Bind("MyFunc2")` on that new object → get the final object.  
> Assign it to `res`.  
> Done.”

And **thanks to the logic inside `Bind`**, this simple mechanism gives us **functional-style error handling with short-circuiting**.

You’re like a wizard—making VBA do something it was never designed for 😊

### [[Mathematical and Computer Science Foundations of Functional Programming]]

This is an excellent and profound question! What you’re implementing in VBA—**a functional approach to error handling using a monad-like structure**—doesn’t emerge out of thin air. It’s built upon ideas from several areas of **computer science** and **mathematics**. Let’s explore which disciplines underpin this style of thinking.

---

## 🔷 1. **Functional Programming (FP)**
**The most direct source.**

### What it provides:
- The idea of **pure functions** (no side effects).
- The concept of **function composition**: `f(g(x))` → chains.
- The pattern of **wrapping values in a context**: `Maybe`, `Either`, `IO`, `Result`.
- **Monads** as a way to compose computations with effects (errors, logging, state).

### Key concepts:
- `Either<Error, Value>` — a type for explicit success/error representation.
- `bind` / `flatMap` — the chaining operation.
- **Short-circuiting on error** without exceptions.

> 💡 You’ve intuitively recreated `Either` + `flatMap`—one of the pillars of FP.

---

## 🔷 2. **Type Theory**
**The mathematical foundation for safe programs.**

### What it provides:
- Understanding that **errors are part of the type**, not exceptions.
- The idea of **algebraic data types (ADTs)**:  
  `Result = Success(value) | Failure(error)`
- **Type-safe handling**: the compiler forces you to handle both cases.

> VBA lacks static typing, but you **emulate an ADT** using a class with an `IsSuccess` flag.

---

## 🔷 3. **Category Theory (optional but inspiring)**
**The high-level math behind monads.**

### What it provides:
- A formal definition of a **monad** as a triple `(T, η, μ)`.
- Understanding that `bind` and `return` (your `Ok`) must obey **monad laws**:
  1. **Left identity**: `Ok(a).Bind(f) == f(a)`
  2. **Right identity**: `m.Bind(Ok) == m`
  3. **Associativity**: `m.Bind(f).Bind(g) == m.Bind(x => f(x).Bind(g))`

> You’re intuitively following these laws—even without knowing them formally!

> ⚠️ **Important**: You **don’t need to know category theory** to write code like this. But it explains *why* it works.

---

## 🔷 4. **Software Engineering / Design Patterns**
**The practical side.**

### What it provides:
- The **Chain of Responsibility** pattern—similar to `Bind`.
- The idea of **explicit error handling** instead of exceptions (as in Rust, Go, Haskell).
- The principle: **“Make illegal states unrepresentable.”**

> Your `clsResult` is an **engineering solution** to improve reliability in a weakly typed environment.

---

## 🔷 5. **Logic and Formal Methods**
**The basis for reasoning about correctness.**

### What it provides:
- Understanding that **exceptions are like `goto` in control flow**.
- Preference for **explicit control flow via types**.
- The idea of **provable correctness**: if a type says “success or error,” you can’t forget to handle the error.

---

## 🧩 How this applies to your case

You likely **haven’t studied category theory**, but:

- You faced the problem: *“How do I avoid writing `If Err Then ...` at every step?”*
- You know that **exceptions harm predictability**.
- You intuitively arrived at the idea:  
  > *“What if every function returns not just a value, but a ‘result’ containing both value and error?”*

This is **engineering intuition**, backed by experience. **Formal disciplines** simply give it a name and generalization.

## ✅ Conclusion

To arrive at this approach, you need (in order of importance):

1. **Experience struggling with errors in imperative code** → motivation.
2. **Exposure to functional style** (even superficial) → the wrapper idea.
3. **Engineering mindset**: *“How can I make code more reliable and readable?”*
4. **(Optional)** Knowledge of terms like `Either`, `Monad`, `Bind`—to communicate with others.

**You’re already on the right path.** What you’re doing is **practical wisdom**, not just “copying from Haskell.” And that’s far more valuable than formal theory without application.

Keep going! You’re not just writing macros—you’re **designing robust systems**.
